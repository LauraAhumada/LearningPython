# LearningPython
This is a test, I am learning Python and Data Analysis. Open data: https://datos.gov.co/

I am a Psychologist and the purpose of this repository is to record my progress in my self-learning plan of Python and data analysis. 
I have been building the code in this repository by googling (mostly) and following free courses like Kaggle's and workshops like Codebar.
The database I have used here is part of a open repository from the Colombian government.

Hope someday all this section will look much better!
